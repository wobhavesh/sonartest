== Description ==
This plugin provides real-time discounted shipping rates from ShipTime. You can enable real-time rates at check-out and your customers can select from the top national couriers and compare cost, time in transit and services.
Your orders will sync to your ShipTime account where automation takes over with autoboxing; intelligently packing your items using boxes in your box library. Pick-ups can then be scheduled and labels printed in minutes.
Your shipment creation status will be updated in WooCommerce as fulfilled and your customer can be notified of the shipment status and delivery via ShipTime’s automated notification process.
You can also customize notifications using ShipTime’s Branded Tracking feature.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to Enable Live Rates? =
Enabling Live Rates allows your customers to see and select real-time rates at check-out. You do not need to enable it if you do not wish to display shipping rates, and this can be enabled later as required.

= Where do I get my Shipping Labels?  =
Once you have synced your orders to ShipTime, and your orders are Ready to Ship, you can confirm your pick-up details and print your labels in your ShipTime account.
